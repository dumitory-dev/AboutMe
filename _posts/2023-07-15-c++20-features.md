# New Features in C++20

C++20, the latest version of the C++ programming language, brings several exciting features and enhancements. These additions aim to improve code readability, simplify development, and provide more expressive power to C++ programmers. Let's explore some of the notable features in C++20:

## Modules
C++20 introduces the concept of **modules**, which allows programmers to organize code into logical units and improve build times. Modules provide a more efficient alternative to traditional header files, enabling faster compilation and better separation of implementation details. With modules, you can write `import` statements to selectively include the desired functionality from a module, reducing the need for preprocessor-based include directives.

**Example:**
```cpp
// math.cppm
module math;

export int add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}
```



```cpp

// main.cpp
import math;

int main()
{
    int result = add(3, 5);
    // Use the add function from the math module
    // ...
    return 0;
}
```


## Concepts

**Concepts**  in C++20 provide a way to define type requirements on templates. They allow you to specify the expected behavior of template arguments and provide more readable error messages when requirements are not met. Concepts enable better static checking of template arguments, resulting in more reliable code and improved compile-time diagnostics.

**Example:** 

```cpp

template<typename T>
concept Integral = std::is_integral_v<T>;

template<Integral T>
T square(T value)
{
    return value * value;
}

int main()
{
    int result = square(5); // Compiles successfully
    // int result = square("hello"); // Fails to compile due to type requirement
    // ...
    return 0;
}
```


## Ranges

The **ranges library**  in C++20 introduces a range-based approach to working with sequences of elements. It provides a more expressive and composable way to manipulate data, with a set of algorithms and range adaptors. The ranges library simplifies common operations like filtering, transforming, and iterating over sequences, making code more concise and readable.

**Example:** 

```cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <ranges>

int main()
{
    std::vector<int> numbers{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Use ranges to filter and transform the elements
    auto result = numbers | std::views::filter([](int n) { return n % 2 == 0; })
                          | std::views::transform([](int n) { return n * n; });

    for (int num : result)
    {
        std::cout << num << " "; // Output: 4 16
    }

    return 0;
}
```


## Coroutines

C++20 introduces **coroutines** , which allow developers to write asynchronous code in a more natural and sequential manner. Coroutines enable the creation of functions that can be suspended and resumed at certain points, allowing for non-blocking operations without the complexity of callbacks or explicit state machines. This feature greatly simplifies asynchronous programming and enhances code readability.

**Example:** 

```cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <coroutine>

struct Generator
{
    struct promise_type
    {
        int current_value;

        auto get_return_object()
        {
            return Generator{std::coroutine_handle<promise_type>::from_promise(*this)};
        }

        auto initial_suspend()
        {
            return std::suspend_always{};
        }

        auto final_suspend() noexcept
        {
            return std::suspend_always{};
        }

        void return_void() {}

        void unhandled_exception() {}
        
        auto yield_value(int value)
        {
            current_value = value;
            return std::suspend_always{};
        }
    };

    std::coroutine_handle<promise_type> coroutine;

    bool move_next()
    {
        coroutine.resume();
        return !coroutine.done();
    }

    int current_value() const
    {
        return coroutine.promise().current_value;
    }

    ~Generator()
    {
        if (coroutine)
            coroutine.destroy();
    }
};

Generator generate_values(int start, int end)
{
    for (int i = start; i <= end; ++i)
    {
        co_yield i;
    }
}

int main()
{
    Generator generator = generate_values(1, 5);

    while (generator.move_next())
    {
        std::cout << generator.current_value() << " "; // Output: 1 2 3 4 5
    }

    return 0;
}
```


## Three-Way Comparisons

C++20 provides built-in support for **three-way comparisons** . This operator allows you to compare objects and obtain a result indicating whether one object is less than, equal to, or greater than another. Three-way comparisons provide a concise and consistent syntax for performing comparisons, reducing boilerplate code and improving code clarity.
## Calendar and Timezone

C++20 includes new **calendar and timezone**  support, providing a standardized way to work with dates and times. The `<chrono>` library now offers calendars, such as the Gregorian and Islamic calendars, and timezones, allowing for precise date and time calculations across different regions and cultures. This feature simplifies handling time-related operations and improves interoperability with other systems.
## Additional Features

In addition to the above features, C++20 includes various other enhancements, such as: 
- **Improved constexpr** : C++20 expands the capabilities of `constexpr` functions, allowing them to be used in more scenarios, including within lambdas and constructors. 
- **containers** : The `std::array` and `std::vector` containers now have more support for `constexpr` operations, enabling them to be used in compile-time computations. 
- **New standard attributes** : C++20 introduces new standard attributes like `[[likely]]` and `[[unlikely]]`, which provide hints to the compiler about the expected branch probability, improving optimization opportunities.
- **std::format**
Introduces a new formatting library, std::format, which provides a type-safe and extensible mechanism for string formatting. This library simplifies the creation of formatted strings and improves type safety compared to traditional formatting options.
- **Consteval Functions**
C++20 introduces the consteval keyword, which allows specifying functions that must be evaluated at compile-time. These functions can be used in constexpr contexts and enable more efficient compile-time computations.

These are just some of the highlights of the new features in C++20. The latest version of the language brings many more enhancements, making C++ more expressive, readable, and efficient.
